# When Should a Language Model Trust Itself: Routing and Reflection for Reliable Generation

## Router

### How to Set Up the Environment

Use Python 3.10 or newer.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn tqdm transformers torch joblib spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Optional dependency for semantic PCA ablation only:

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers
```

Additional dependencies for the RAG pipeline and R2R baseline comparison:

```bash
pip install wikipedia-api sentence-transformers bitsandbytes accelerate
```

Notes:
- The inference script downloads the Hugging Face model specified by `--hf-model-id`.
- If you want to control the Hugging Face cache location, set `HF_HOME` before running inference.

### Device or System Used to Run the Code

This codebase is set up for two main environments:

- Apple Silicon macOS with PyTorch MPS acceleration. This is the default local inference path (`--device mps`).
- Linux GPU nodes with NVIDIA CUDA. The repository includes Slurm scripts for USC CARC in [scripts/run_qwen_3b.slurm](/scripts/run_qwen_3b.slurm) and [scripts/run_qwen_7b.slurm](/scripts/run_qwen_7b.slurm).

The inference script also supports CPU with `--device cpu`.

The R2R baseline comparison (`src/r2r_baseline_comparison.py`) requires a CUDA GPU with at least 16 GB VRAM (A100 recommended). It uses 4-bit quantization via bitsandbytes.

### Instructions for Running the Code

Run the pipeline from the repository root.

#### 1. Generate model inference outputs

```bash
python src/inference_qwen_mcq.py \
  --model_name qwen2.5-0.5b \
  --input_path data/raw/Train.csv \
  --hf-model-id Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct \
  --device mps

python src/inference_qwen_mcq.py \
  --model_name qwen2.5-0.5b \
  --input_path data/raw/Test.csv \
  --hf-model-id Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct \
  --device mps
```

This step writes inference results to:

- `data/processed/qwen2.5-0.5b/inference_results_train.pkl`
- `data/processed/qwen2.5-0.5b/inference_results_test.pkl`

#### 2. Build router feature matrices

```bash
python src/prepare_dataset.py --model_name qwen2.5-0.5b --split train
python src/prepare_dataset.py --model_name qwen2.5-0.5b --split test
```

This step writes:

- `data/processed/qwen2.5-0.5b/router_training_matrix_train.pkl`
- `data/processed/qwen2.5-0.5b/router_training_matrix_test.pkl`

#### 3. Train and evaluate the router

```bash
python src/trainer.py \
  --model_name qwen2.5-0.5b \
  --input_path data/processed/qwen2.5-0.5b/router_training_matrix_train.pkl \
  --test_input_path data/processed/qwen2.5-0.5b/router_training_matrix_test.pkl
```

This step writes:

- `models/qwen2.5-0.5b/router_model.joblib`
- `outputs/qwen2.5-0.5b/calibration.png`
- `outputs/qwen2.5-0.5b/feature_importance.png`

#### 4. Run R2R baseline comparison (Router + RAG)

This runs all three conditions (No RAG, Always RAG, Router RAG) on the test set using the trained router and the RAG retrieval pipeline. Requires a CUDA GPU.

```bash
python src/r2r_baseline_comparison.py \
  --model_name qwen2.5-3B \
  --hf_model_id Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct \
  --router_path models/qwen2.5-3B/router_model.joblib \
  --feature_matrix data/processed/qwen2.5-3B/router_training_matrix_test.csv \
  --test_csv data/raw/Test.csv
```

For other model sizes, swap the paths:

```bash
# 7B
python src/r2r_baseline_comparison.py \
  --model_name qwen2.5-7B \
  --hf_model_id Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct \
  --router_path models/qwen2.5-7B/router_model.joblib \
  --feature_matrix data/processed/qwen2.5-7B/router_training_matrix_test.csv \
  --test_csv data/raw/Test.csv

# 14B
python src/r2r_baseline_comparison.py \
  --model_name qwen2.5-14B \
  --hf_model_id Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct \
  --router_path models/qwen2.5-14B/router_model.joblib \
  --feature_matrix data/processed/qwen2.5-14B/router_training_matrix_test.csv \
  --test_csv data/raw/Test.csv

# 32B
python src/r2r_baseline_comparison.py \
  --model_name qwen2.5-32B \
  --hf_model_id Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct \
  --router_path models/qwen2.5-32B/router_model.joblib \
  --feature_matrix data/processed/qwen2.5-32B/router_training_matrix_test.csv \
  --test_csv data/raw/Test.csv
```

This step writes:

- `outputs/<model_name>/r2r_baseline_comparison.csv`

#### 5. Optional report figures

```bash
python src/generate_report_visuals.py
python src/report_charts.py
```

#### 6. Generate a new evaluation dataset

To sample a fresh set of questions with deduplication against the existing training pool:

```bash
python scripts/generate_dataset.py \
  --existing_csv data/raw/RouterReflector_Combined_Dataset.csv \
  --samples_per_dataset 500 \
  --output_dir data/raw/ \
  --seed 42
```

This produces three stratified splits with zero overlap against the existing dataset:

- `data/raw/Train.csv` (2,400 questions, 400 per benchmark)
- `data/raw/Validation.csv` (300 questions, 50 per benchmark)
- `data/raw/Test.csv` (300 questions, 50 per benchmark)

### How the Results Are Generated

The project generates results in four stages:

1. `src/inference_qwen_mcq.py` runs a Hugging Face causal language model on each multiple-choice question and stores the predicted answer together with uncertainty signals such as entropy, perplexity, chosen-token probability, and top-5 first-token log-probabilities.
2. `src/prepare_dataset.py` converts those inference outputs into a router dataset. It creates `target_label = 1` when the base model is wrong and `target_label = 0` when the base model is correct, then builds the default 22 `feat_*` features from text patterns, spaCy features, and model-confidence features.
3. `src/trainer.py` trains and compares routing baselines, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and a tuned XGBoost router. It evaluates them with F1 and ROC-AUC, produces the calibration and feature-importance figures, and saves the best router model.
4. `src/r2r_baseline_comparison.py` runs the end-to-end R2R evaluation. For each test question, it runs three conditions: No RAG (vanilla), Always RAG (raw unfiltered Wikipedia context on every question), and Router RAG (retrieval triggered only when the router predicts failure, with similarity filtering). The RAG retrieval pipeline (`src/rag_pipeline.py`) handles Wikipedia search and passage filtering.

### RAG Pipeline Details

The RAG module (`src/rag_pipeline.py`) retrieves external context from Wikipedia in two stages:

**Query formulation** uses a cascading strategy:
1. Named entities extracted via capitalized phrase detection (e.g., "Mount Kilimanjaro")
2. Content keywords after stopword removal
3. Cleaned question text as fallback

Each query is passed to Wikipedia's opensearch API, which returns pages ranked by relevance. Up to 3 passages are retrieved per question.

**Relevance filtering** uses Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to compute cosine similarity between the question and each retrieved passage. Passages below a threshold of 0.3 are discarded. In practice, over 90% of questions receive zero passages after filtering.

For the Always RAG baseline, the similarity filter is removed to show the true cost of indiscriminate retrieval. For Router RAG, the filter is applied and retrieval is only triggered when the router predicts failure.

### Running 14B and 32B on USC CARC

Extending the pipeline to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct. Submit from the repo root after activating the venv:

```bash
source venv_carc/bin/activate
```

#### Step 1 — Inference

**14B** (~10 hrs for Train split, runs on V100):
```bash
sbatch scripts/run_qwen_14b.slurm
```

**32B** (~3 hrs per split, uses 4-bit quantization on p100:2):
```bash
sbatch scripts/run_qwen_32b.slurm
```

> Note: For 32B, set `HF_HOME` to a scratch directory to avoid home quota issues:
> `export HF_HOME=/scratch1/<your_username>/hf_cache`

Outputs: `data/processed/qwen2.5-{14B,32B}/inference_results_{train,validation,test}.{pkl,csv}`

#### Step 2 — Feature Engineering
```bash
sbatch scripts/prepare_dataset_14b.sh
sbatch scripts/prepare_dataset_32b.sh
```

Outputs: `data/processed/qwen2.5-{14B,32B}/router_training_matrix_{split}.{pkl,csv}`

#### Step 3 — Router Training
```bash
sbatch scripts/trainer_14b.sh
sbatch scripts/trainer_32b.sh
```

Outputs: `models/qwen2.5-{14B,32B}/router_model.joblib`, `outputs/qwen2.5-{14B,32B}/`

#### Step 4 — R2R Baseline Comparison

After router training, run the three-way comparison for each model size:

```bash
python src/r2r_baseline_comparison.py \
  --model_name qwen2.5-14B \
  --hf_model_id Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct \
  --router_path models/qwen2.5-14B/router_model.joblib \
  --feature_matrix data/processed/qwen2.5-14B/router_training_matrix_test.csv \
  --test_csv data/raw/Test.csv
```

```
python src/r2r_baseline_comparison.py \
  --model_name qwen2.5-32B \
  --hf_model_id Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct \
  --router_path models/qwen2.5-32B/router_model.joblib \
  --feature_matrix data/processed/qwen2.5-32B/router_training_matrix_test.csv \
  --test_csv data/raw/Test.csv
```
---

## Reflector

The **reflector** is a complementary component to the router. Rather than routing questions to an external retrieval system, it decides whether the model should re-answer a question using a different prompting strategy — all based on the model's own internal uncertainty signals, with no ground-truth labels at inference time.

### Concept

When a language model answers a multiple-choice question, each candidate label receives a probability under the first-token distribution. Two signals extracted from this distribution are particularly informative:

- **Margin** — `p(top1) − p(top2)`: how decisively the model picked one answer over the second-best.
- **Entropy over labels** — Shannon entropy of the label-probability distribution: how spread out the model's probability mass is across the options.

Both signals have ROC-AUC ≈ 0.82 when used to predict whether the model's answer is wrong (measured over 1 500 MCQ questions, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct). Low margin or high entropy is a reliable indicator that a second pass is worth attempting.

### How It Works

Each question goes through up to two inference passes.

**Pass 1 — Direct pass**

The model answers the question normally. The first-token distribution over option labels is recorded. Confidence thresholds are set from the 25th / 50th / 75th percentiles of these signals across the evaluation set. Each question is assigned a regime:

| Regime | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| `high` | entropy ≤ median AND margin ≥ median |
| `low` | entropy ≥ 75th pct OR margin ≤ 25th pct |
| `medium` | everything else |

**Policy decision**

A reflection policy decides whether to trigger a second pass based solely on the direct-pass signals:

| Policy | Reflects when |
|--------|---------------|
| `direct_baseline` | Never (baseline) |
| `always_reflect_once` | Always |
| `blind_gate_once` | Regime is `medium` or `low` |
| `oracle_gate_once` | Model was wrong — uses gold label (upper bound, not deployable) |
| `*_twice` variants | Same gates, but up to 2 reflection passes; pass 2 is skipped if confidence rises to `high` after pass 1 |

**Pass 2 — Reflection pass**

When reflection is triggered, a different system prompt instructs the model to approach the problem from a fresh angle. Four prompt styles are available and rotate across passes:

| Style | Instruction given to the model |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| `plain_retry` | Evaluate from scratch with a fresh pass |
| `error_scan` | Silently scan for mistakes — negation, option mismatch, unsupported assumptions |
| `option_elimination` | Silently eliminate the weakest options, then choose the strongest remaining |
| `evidence_reconstruction` | Silently reconstruct the key evidence before deciding |

All reflection prompts are label-only (no chain-of-thought output), so the uncertainty signals from pass 2 are directly comparable to pass 1 signals. None of the prompts reveal the model's previous answer.

**Abstention**

When abstention is enabled (`ENABLE_ABSTAIN = True`), if the model's confidence regime after the final reflection pass is still `low`, the system outputs `NOT_SURE` instead of a forced label. Metrics are reported both with abstention (selective accuracy, coverage) and without it (forced accuracy).

### Context Handling

The dataset contains questions from six sources. Only **ReClor** questions include a reading passage. Context is passed to the model for ReClor rows only — all other sources receive no context. This is validated automatically in the notebook before analysis runs.

### Dataset

The reflector evaluates on `data/raw/Test.csv`: 300 questions, 50 from each of the six sources — SciQ, MedQA, MMLU, ARC-Easy, ReClor, and AQUA-RAT.

### How to Run the Reflector

The reflector runs as Jupyter notebooks in **Google Colab** with a GPU runtime. Models are loaded in 4-bit quantization (NF4 via bitsandbytes), so you can run this on Colab's GPU runtime without needing a local GPU.

#### Main notebook — full policy × prompt grid

`reflector/Reflection_Policy_Prompt_Grid.ipynb`

This is the primary deliverable. It runs all 4 model sizes (3B / 7B / 14B / 32B) through every combination of 6 policies × 4 prompt styles on the full `Test.csv`.

**Setup**:

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab and enable a GPU runtime (`Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU`).
2. Mount Google Drive when prompted. The notebook creates a `NLP Project/reflection-policy-prompt-grid/` folder there and caches all intermediate results. If a run is interrupted, re-running the notebook resumes from the last completed combination without re-running inference.
3. Place `Test.csv` in `My Drive/NLP Project/New Dataset/Test.csv`, or update `DATA_PATH` in cell 2.
4. Cell 2 installs all required packages automatically (`bitsandbytes`, `accelerate`, `transformers`, `sentencepiece`, `safetensors`).

**What it produces** (saved to Google Drive):

- `direct_results.csv` — per-model first-pass predictions and uncertainty signals for every row
- `experiment_rows.csv` — per-model results for every (policy, prompt style) combination
- `blind_thresholds.json` — data-driven confidence thresholds derived from the direct-pass distribution
- `summary_metrics.csv` — aggregated accuracy, abstention rate, correction rate, degradation rate
- `summary_by_source.csv` — same metrics broken down by dataset source
- `blind_oracle_gap.csv` — how much blind gating falls short of the oracle upper bound
- `one_vs_two_pass_comparison.csv` — delta between single-pass and two-pass reflection
- `regime_breakdown.csv` — trigger rate and accuracy split by confidence regime
- PNG heatmaps for forced accuracy, selective accuracy, abstention rate, correction rate, degradation rate, and per-source breakdowns

#### Initial experiment notebooks

`reflector/initial experiments/` contains the exploratory notebooks that established the approach:

| Notebook | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `Router_Reflector_Dataset_Gathering.ipynb` | Data collection and dataset curation |
| `Router_Reflector_Dataset_Exploration.ipynb` | EDA — source distribution, label balance, signal distributions |
| `Reflector_Baselines_Exploration.ipynb` | Early baseline experiments |
| `Reflector_Experiments.ipynb` | Three structured experiments: baseline accuracy, oracle retry upper bound, and signal quality for predicting errors |
| `MCQ_Combined_Experiments_3B/7B/14B/32B.ipynb` | Per-model combined experiments across model sizes |

These notebooks are designed to run sequentially. Each saves results to disk so later cells can load from checkpoints. `Reflector_Experiments.ipynb` is the best starting point to understand the signal analysis.

### Key Results

All numbers are from `Reflector_Experiments.ipynb` on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct over 1 500 questions.

**Uncertainty signals predict errors reliably**

| Signal | ROC-AUC | Avg Precision |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Entropy over labels | 0.819 | 0.644 |
| Entropy over vocab | 0.819 | 0.643 |
| 1 − margin | 0.818 | 0.637 |
| 1 − top-1 prob | 0.819 | 0.638 |

All four signals perform similarly, confirming that the first-token label distribution is a reliable proxy for model confidence.

**Oracle retry recovery (upper bound)**

When the model is wrong and given a structured retry prompt:
- 37.8% of wrong answers are recovered
- Baseline accuracy: 65.1% → post-retry accuracy: 78.3% (+13.2 pp)
- Answer change rate: 99.6% (the model almost always picks a different label when told it was wrong)

This establishes the ceiling for reflection-based improvement. The `oracle_gate` policy in the main notebook approximates this upper bound; `blind_gate` is the deployable version that uses only uncertainty signals.
